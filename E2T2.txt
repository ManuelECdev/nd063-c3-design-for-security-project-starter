1. On instance i-0f4be21f594f3db2e, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet

Disable login via ssh and use AWS Systems Manager.

2. Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance i-0f4be21f594f3db2e in your assessment target.

Disable  login via password.

3. On instance i-0f4be21f594f3db2e, process 'systemd-netwo' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet

Connect the instance to a private network so it is not reachable from the internet and stop listening in port UPD 68.

4. Instance i-0f4be21f594f3db2e is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.

Disable login via ssh and use AWS Systems Manager.

5. Instance i-0f4be21f594f3db2e  is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.

Disable  login via password.

6. No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on instance i-0f4be21f594f3db2e in your assessment target. This allows users to set simple passwords, thereby increasing the chances of unauthorized users gaining access and misusing accounts.
