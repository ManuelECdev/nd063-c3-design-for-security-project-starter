1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

  	1. Disable the posibility of using passwords for authenticating with ssh and use key files or AWS System Manager to manage the instance.
	2. Connect the instance to private networks so it is not reachable from the internet. 
	3. Create a security group with inbound rules to allow connections only from trusted ips.

2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?

Creating a more restrictive aim role and allowing only access to the free recipes bucket only.
