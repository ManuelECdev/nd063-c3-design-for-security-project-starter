1.Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. b. Scan AMI\'92s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.


Scan OS or container for vulnerabilities:

Clair
Anchore
Dagda
Falco
Aqua Security
Docker Bench
Harbor
JFrog Xray
Qualys
Docker Scan


Scan Infrastructure as code for vulnerabilities:

 
Cfripper 
Cloudsploit 
cfn-lint  
Chef inspec 
Regula 
Terrascan

Post-deployment compliance scanning tools:

AWS Inspector 
AWS Config
AWS security hub

  

2. For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which it might expose.

Scan Infrastructure as code for vulnerabilities  tools:

Vulnerabilities such as iam policies with too many permissions.


Containers and OS tools :

Vulnerabilities due to software bugs.


Post-deployment compliance scanning tools:

Allowing SSH password login
Security groups with incoming rules of 0.0.0.0/0 port 22.
Operating System Vulnerabilities
S3 Buckets without encryption in rest.
Cloud resources without logging enabled.
